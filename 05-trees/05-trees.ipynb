    "### Searching\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching for a value `x` in a BST in a tree rooted at `node`, one can use the following algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - if the label of `node` is `x`, then we are done.\n",
    "  - if `x` is (strictly) smaller than the label of `node`, then we (recursively) search `x` in the left subtree of `node` (but we do **not** search it in the right subtree).\n",
    "  - likewise, if `x` is (strictly) larger than the label of `node`, then we (recursively) search `x` in the right subtree of `node` (but we do **not** search in the left subtree).\n",
    "  \n",
    "As you can see, at each step, we go down in the tree and never go back or backtrack (i.e. revise a previous decision). So at most, we are going to do a number of comparisons that is proportional to the height of the tree - if the tree is balanced (we will define this more formally later), the height is going to be proportional to the **logarithm** of the number of elements --- i.e. this is going to be a big improvment over a linear search in a list and is comparable to a binary search in a sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why can we decide to ignore some subtrees? Because of the data-invariant that we imposed on BST. For example, let's go back to our example and assume that we are in the second case: `x` is strictly small than the label of `node`. Since we have a BST, we know that all the labels in the right subtree of `node` are going to be larger than `node`'s label. Hence, all labels in the right subtree of `node` are going to be strictly larger than `x`. In consequence, `x` **cannot** be in the right subtree. It remains to check whether `x` is in the left subtree or not.\n",

However, when we cannot progress more, we then insert a new left with `x` at its label. This gives the following algorithm:\n",

    "  - if `node` is `None`, we create a new `Node`, with `x` as its label and with no children.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Here, the algorithm works because: 1. after insertion, the BST has been augmented with a single `Node` whose label is `x`, and 2. by pushing `x` on the left (resp. right) when it is strictly smaller than (resp. larger than) the node label, we insert `x` in a place s.t. it doesn't break the BST invariants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here too, when the tree is balanced, the insertion will make a number of comparisons that is proportional to the logarothm of the numbers of nodes of the tree.\n",
